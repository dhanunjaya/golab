create a workspace in home directory:
mkdir mygoenv

set GOPATH env variable:
export GOPATH=$HOME/mygoenv

cd $GOPATH

mkdir -p src/github.com/dhanunjaya

for every package create a unique directory and do
go build && go install, and all the packages will be in $GOPATH/pkg

other than packages do
go install, and all binaries sit in $GOPATH/bin

this will get the code from github and install into local workspace
go get github.com/dhanunjaya/somecode
